# Java-Tic-Tac-Toe
A very simple text-based, 2-player tictactoe game in Java running in an IDE console environment.

The tic-tac-toe game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The game is played by two players, who take turns. The first player marks moves with a '1', the second with a '2'. The player who has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks wins. This program draws the game board, asks the user for the coordinates (row#, col#) of the next mark, changes the players after every successful move, and pronounces the winner.

1. GUI to come, with JavaFX. 
2. For now, run the .java file as a simple java class in NetBeans IDE 8.1 or Eclipse and play it on the console.
